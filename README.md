# PRODIGY_DS_01
# Data Science Internship Task 1

## Introduction
Mastering information representation is crucial in data analysis and visualization. Proficiency in crafting customizable charts enables concise and precise expression of ideas. This exercise focuses on enhancing data presentation skills by visualizing age distribution and gender breakdown, fostering a deeper understanding of the dataset.

## Dataset
The dataset used is <a href="https://github.com/Seetha-2002/PRODIGY_DS_01/blob/main/worldpopulationdata.csv">world_population_dataset</a>.
The dataset covers population records from 2001 to 2022, offering insights into global demographic trends, age distribution, gender demographics, and other population-related factors. It serves as a valuable resource for understanding global population dynamics.

Series             Code	Meaning
SP.POP.TOTL	       Population, total
SP.POP.TOTL.FE.IN	 Population, female
SP.POP.TOTL.MA.IN	 Population, male
SP.POP.TOTL.FE.ZS	 Population, female (% of total population)
SP.POP.TOTL.MA.ZS	 Population, male (% of total population)

## Conclusion
Key insights into the distribution of the selected variable were gleaned from histograms and scatter plots depicting the respective categorical variables in the dataset. This exploration sets the stage for forthcoming data science modeling tasks and inquiries, offering a robust foundation for analysis and informed decision-making.
